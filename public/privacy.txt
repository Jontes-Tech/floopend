We are internet privacy advocates. Therefore we track our users in the smallest way possible. 

We do not use cookies, and neither do we use Google Analytics, but we do use a self-hosted analytics software called Plausible. This is hosted in Germany.
You can rest assured that we do not track you in any way that could be used to identify you. If you do not believe us, you may visit https://stats.jontes.page/floopr.org to see for yourself.

We do keep logs of the IP addresses of all users, but we do not use them for anything other than to prevent abuse of our services. We flush these logs regularly.

Our website is hosted in Germany on Edgeserver by V3X Labs. They run their own webserver software, which is open source and can be found at https://github.com/v3xlabs/Edgeserver. We do not have access to these logs.

The backend is running custom softare by me (https://github.com/Jontes-Tech/floopr-api) behind Nginx on a server in Germany.

Thank you for trusting us, and we hope you enjoy our FLOSS services.
